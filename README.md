## 🚀 A Little About Me

- **Curious Data Explorer:**  
  I love digging into data and building smart systems—whether it’s Python, C++, Java, or MySQL, I’m at home finding patterns and creating machine learning models with tools like NumPy and PyTorch.

- **Storyteller with Numbers:**  
  MS Excel, Google Sheets, and PowerPoint aren’t just productivity tools—they’re my canvas for bringing insights to life, making complex info accessible and actionable.

- **UX Enthusiast & Web Creator:**  
  Figma is my playground for crafting intuitive user interfaces. I believe great design should feel effortless, so I’m always refining, testing, and learning what makes users tick.
